pkgcore currently is available under GPL2; everything but pkgcore/bin/ebuild-*
is available under BSD 3 class or GPL-2, pkgcore/bin/ebuild-* however is GPL2.

At some point down the line pkgcore will become pure BSD/GPL2 via moving
pkgcore/bin/ebuild-* bits into a seperate pkg; till then if desired to use it
under just BSD terms those files must be excluded.
